### Fixes
- REMS now exits with status 0 on SIGINT and SIGTERM
- REMS now sets PostgreSQL `lock_timeout` (configurable, defaults to 10s) and `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` (configurable, defaults to 20s) to avoid deadlocks (#2101)

## v2.9 "Olarinluoma" 2020-03-26

### Breaking changes

  - Catalogue items that share a workflow but have different forms can now be bundled into one application.

  - Events with `form/id` will have a `application/forms` where each has a `form/id`.

- Show resources, forms, licenses and workflows from all organizations to organization owners (#1893)
- API: comments are now optional for commands

## v2.7 "Koivuviidantie" 2020-02-03

### Breaking changes
- Removed support for LDAP authentication
- `/api/workflows/create` API: the `type` parameter's allowed value was changed from `dynamic` to `workflow/dynamic`

- `/api/applications/commenters` API renamed to `/api/applications/reviewers`
- field/id is now a string. This considers creating forms and the form API, but also form users may have the assumption of integers.

### Additions

  are disabled and archived. The name of the new item will be exactly
  the same as before. See #837

  - `/api/email/send-handler-reminder` sends email about open applications to all handlers.
  - `/api/email/send-reviewer-reminder` sends email about applications with open review requests to reviewers.

## v2.6 "Kalevalantie" 2019-11-12

### Breaking changes
- `:application/external-id` has been made a non-optional field in the
  API and event schemas. All applications should already have an external ID
  since the previous release, so no database migration should be needed.
- The pdf button and API have been removed. We recommend using "print
  to pdf" in your browser.
- The `start`, `end` and `expired` fields have been removed from licenses,
  workflows, resources, and forms.
- API for creating catalogue item and its localizations has been changed.
  There is now a single API call that is used to create both a catalogue
  item and the localizations, namely, /api/catalogue-items/create.
- APIs for editing workflow, catalogue item, form, resource, or license
  have been changed:
  - The API endpoint for editing content (the name and handlers) of a
    workflow is now /api/workflows/edit.
  - The endpoint for archiving or unarchiving a workflow, a catalogue item,
    a form, a resource, or a license is /archived, prefixed with
    /api/workflows, /api/catalogue-item, /api/forms, /api/resources,
    or /api/licenses, respectively.
  - The endpoint for enabling or disabling a workflow, a catalogue item,
    a form, a resource, or a license is /enabled, prefixed with
    /api/workflows, /api/catalogue-items, /api/forms, /api/resources,
    or /api/licenses, respectively.
- API endpoint for editing forms has been changed from
  /api/forms/[form-id]/edit to /api/forms/edit.
- The page addresses are no more prefixed with `/#/`, so for example the address
  of the catalogue page was changed from `/#/catalogue` to `/catalogue` (#1258)
- More consistent user attributes in APIs (e.g. /api/application/:id,
  /api/users/create) (#1726)

## v2.5 "Maarintie" 2019-07-18

### Breaking changes
- Removed support for old round-based workflows
- Removed support for transferring REMS 1 data
- Replace applications API with new one (for dynamic applications)

### Additions
- Dynamic workflows

This is the last release that still supports round based workflows. Please use this version to convert to dynamic workflows. There are also many changes and fixes since last version, which will be listed in the next release.

WARNING! The migration has problems with databases where licenses have been revoked, if the related entitlements are still active. See #1372.

1. Run lein run migrate in rems/ repository. NOTE! If you can't run lein on target server, use an SSH tunnel. Make sure you have no previous tunnels running!
   ssh -L 5432:remsdbserver:5432 remsappserver
   AND then run on your local machine:
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pw@localhost/db_name" lein run migrate

2. Create a dynamic workflow

3. Check new, dynamic workflow id from database:
   select * from workflow order by start desc;

4. Run on your own machine lein run convert-to-dynamic <dynamic_workflow_id> NOTE! If you can't run lein on target server, see step 1 for tunneling.

5. Verify from database that all applications have the new, dynamic workflow id in column wfid: select * from catalogue_item_application;

6. Go to administration page in UI and archive all non-dynamic workflows. If you do not have admin privileges, add them by adding owner role for yourself into the database:
   insert into roles (userid, role) = ('[userid]', 'owner')
   where [userid] is the eppn of your account (email address).

7. Verify from ui that different kind of applications still work.
