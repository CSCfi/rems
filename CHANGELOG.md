# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
Pull requests should add lines under the Unreleased heading if they
have notable changes.

## Unreleased

Changes since v2.36

### Additions
- The "Change Form" function in administration has been expanded to be able to change both forms and workflows. From now on it is called "Update catalogue item". The old `change-form` API still exists but has been deprecated. (#3271)

### Changes
    - Invitation links work multiple times. Previously, they were single-use. The invitation token is spent on the first use and it grants the rights then. However, the user may still use the link later for navigating into the application or workflow in question. (#3275)

## v2.36 "Laivapojankuja" 2024-03-13

### Additions
- (Experimental) Voting options are expanded to have types, i.e. reviewer and handler voting. Use `:enable-voting`. (#3257)
- Email templates (`:t.email/...`) and event translations (`:t.applications.events/...`) now support named format parameters, and default english localizations have been updated for reference. While REMS moves towards fully supporting named parameters, all translations with index parameters should continue to work. Localizations with many parameters (like emails) have been burdensome to maintain with index parameters, so transitioning into named parameters is highly encouraged. (#3241)
- Processing states have been added. Now, in addition to the main states (draft, submitted, returned, approved, ...), the application tracks new "processing states" (i.e, "sub-states"). They can be added to facilitate for example standard bookkeeping of an application or technical integrations. The handler can change an application's processing state, when at least one has been configured in the application's workflow by the owner. Use `:enable-processing-states`. (#3259)

### Changes
- Form fields in workflow admin pages are re-structured to show most often needed fields first.

## v2.35.1 "Selkämerenkatu +1" 2024-01-16

**NB: This release contains migrations!**

### Changes
- The EGA implementation has been removed as unnecessary. It's not used and the plugins supersede this feature. (#3239).
- The word experimental has been dropped from the catalogue tree API as it is a standard feature already. (#3251)

### Fixes
- Fix issue with user roles after deletion. This was introduced in the previous release that optimizes cache updates. (#3243)
- Mark form as optional in catalogue item creation. Also consider categories optional unless the catalogue tree is enabled. (#3244)

## v2.35 "Selkämerenkatu" 2023-12-13

**NB: This release removes the experimental application PDF export API. The non-experimental PDF export API is preferred instead. (#3098)**

### Additions
- By default administration pages show only "own organization" items. (#2046)
- The command-line use of REMS has been sped up. There are new commands `dev-setup` and `perf-setup` that `dev_db.sh` uses to start faster (a combination of migrate and data).
- Application expiration can be configured with `:application-expiration-process-limit` to process a subset of applications instead of everything at once. (#3225)
- Show organization in create workflow Forms dropdown (#3230)
- When copying an item, reset the organization, if it's not owned by the user. (#2880)
- Added malware scanning support. When `:malware-scanner-path` is set REMS will scan uploaded attachments and licenses with the executable at the provided path. Enabling `:enable-malware-scanner-logging` will pass the scanner executables output on `STDERR` to the REMS application log. (#2905)

### Changes
- Application expiration now logs more, and more often. (#3225)
- Catalogue page has been sped up with optimizations. The API supports not joining organization data if not required (`join-organization=false`).
- Adding a user to blacklist does not reload the full cache anymore. This should make it faster. Also the user is directed to Applications page after delete, not to Catalogue.
- Deleting a (draft) application is now faster because it does not reload the full cache, only update it.
- Editing workflows (e.g. handlers) should now be faster because it does not reload the full cache, only update it.

### Fixes
- Big improvements in performance from small improvements in how applications and events are processed and cached. REMS should be able to handle a 100k event DB without breaking a sweat. (#2783)
- Administration dropdown buttons should now respond to clicks more widely, and not only by directly clicking text. (#3167)
- Catalogue item unarchive should no longer fail when form does not exist. (#3217)
- Current page updates correctly. (#3218)
- Fixed faulty check in application expiration that prevents sending expiration notifications for applications, and expiring those applications. (#3225)

## v2.34.2 "Santakatu +2" 2023-11-03

### Fixes
- DUO codes in draft saved event no longer cause schema validation error when `:enable-duo` config is false.

## v2.34.1 "Santakatu +1" 2023-11-03

**NB: This release contains migrations!**

### Fixes
- A bug in event selection prevented migration (introduced in v2.34) from applying properly. This release contains a fixed version of that migration.

## v2.34 "Santakatu" 2023-10-31

**NB: This release contains migrations!**
**NB: `:application/public` is renamed to `:event/public` (in `application_event` table `eventdata` column).**
**NB: `:expires-on` is renamed to `:application/expires-on` (in `application_event` table `eventdata` column).**
**NB: `:last-activity` is redundant and removed from the event (in `application_event` table `eventdata` column).**

### Changes
- "Show related events" has been removed from events. (#3156)
- Handler can now redact other handlers attachments. (#3190)
- The tables take advantage of a new paging feature. Especially, the handler Actions page and its handled applications table uses paging and only fetches handled applications when so requested. The first 50 rows are only fetched by default. Paging can be also configured per table, if the default is not good (page size 50 rows). (#3191)
- If reminder email is configured for the, expirer bot, it will delete an old draft application if and only if the reminder email is sent and the specified amount of time has passed. Previously it would just delete if the application was very old (esp. when enabling expiry for the first time).
- Allow leaving `:form` field away from catalogue item creation API calls. Previously the value was optional but now the key too.
- Application action buttons now wait until request has completed. This should prevent duplicate concurrent requests caused by repeated clicking. (#3204)

### Additions
- (Experimental) Workflow can be configured to enable voting for the approval. Currently all handlers can vote (including bots). Use `:enable-voting`. (#3174)
- There is now a Danish language translation (#3176). We are considering supporting a limited set of languages officially, and improving support for community maintained translations (see #3179).
- Added experimental support for named format parameters in translations. (#3183)
- Added extended logging option (`:enable-extended-logging`), for additionally logging the content of mutating operations. (#3184)
- Cache reloading can be configured using the new `:buzy-hours` config. REMS will then try to avoid reloading during the specified time spans. (#3194)
- Application expiration respects `:buzy hours` config too.
- The handling users can now see whether an event is shown to the applicant from a small eye icon in the event history. (#3156)
- Event now shows which attachments were redacted when viewing as handling user. (#3190)
- Workflow has new option to anonymize handling users. When enabled, applying users may only see "Handler" in events where handling user's name would appear. Event emails to applying users similarly show only anonymized name where handling user's name would appear. Application API also returns only anonymized name to applying users. Anonymized name is customizable with translation key `:t.roles/anonymous-handler`, which defaults to `:t.roles/handler`.

### Fixes
- Email template parameters for `:application-expiration-notification` event are now documented. The parameters are different from standard event email parameters, which may have caused confusion.

## v2.33 "Santakuja" 2023-06-19

### Additions
- PDF output can be customized a little. This enables changing the font, which should fix missing diacritics. (#3158)
- Workflows can now disable commands dynamically by application state, user role, or both. Rules can be set in workflow administration page under disable commands field. (#3131)
- Plugins can be written to extend REMS functionality in select extension points. So far there is support for plugins written in Clojure embedded in Markdown files. See `docs/plugins.md` for details. (#3133)

### Fixes
- Label and header fields have URLs made into links. (#3155)

## v2.32 "Itämerenkatu" 2023-04-26

**NB: GET /entitlements.csv is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please use GET /api/entitlements/export-csv instead.**
**NB: Experimental application PDF export API is deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. The non-experimental PDF export API is preferred instead. (#3098)**

### Changes
- Application editing performance is improved. (#3106)
- Show form errors column only when some form has errors. (#3107)
- Latest event is now shown in the minimized application state. (#3119)
- Administration menu has been fine-tuned. Reports also shows only if
  the user can access it.
- The administration pages can now scale wider than before.
- The administration tables use a dropdown button for the modification actions.
  This allows more space for the table contents as there will be less buttons visible.
  Some of the buttons are only visible if the user has the permission. (#2814)
- The catalogue items page (in administration) is now sorted by the item creation time by default.
  Newly created items will now appear at the top instead of somewhere in the alphabetical order.
  The sort can still be changed by clicking on the column headers.
- The catalogue page margins have been adjusted to be more consistent. Also some of the default
  texts have been removed. They can still be added by extra translations.
- Catalogue "more info" is now styled as a link instead of a button.
- Actions page columns have been tuned, e.g. description, resource and applicant, so that they wrap nicely. (#3121, #3122)
- Accessibility tooling has been upgraded, the report improved, and serious issues fixed.
- Prefer and set language cookie so a db request is spared. (#3136)
- Logging has been adjusted:
  - Don't add static resources to audit log. (#3136)
  - Provide entry logging earlier (`req >`), even before user or roles are fetched.
  - Log a short request id for every request.
  - Log the simultaneous request count (`rqc:`).
  - Reduce duplicate logging from each line (user, request method).
  - Print the time it took to serve the request (`ms`).

### Additions
- User attributes can now be retrieved from ID token and user_info endpoint. (#3028)
- User attributes are now formatted better (a boolean becomes a checkbox, etc.) (#3103)
- Most handler, reviewer, decider emails can be disabled with `:enable-handler-emails false`. (#3116)
  This does not include the invitation emails, which will always be sent, to be able to invite users.
  This also does not include any reminder emails that you can separately enable if you wish.
- Any individual email can be disabled by setting its translation to empty string `""` (#3117).
- Handler, reviewer and decider can now redact application attachments. (#2491)
  * Redacted attachment exists in REMS like any other attachment, but it's file contents are permanently removed, and filename is shown to other non-handler users as redacted.
  * Attachments in field answers cannot be redacted, but the applicant can edit them as usual when application is draft or returned.
  * Handler can redact attachments also from other users.
  * Non-handler users can redact only their own attachments.
  * In decider workflow handler is not allowed to redact decider attachments.
- Database connection pool can be configured, see `:hikaricp-extra-params` in `config-defaults.edn`.
- The debug log level prints details of when the scheduled pollers run, e.g. email and event notification.
- Search bar automatically trims the whitespace form the left side, which is useful for copied values.
- The event notification can be configured to not send the application data with `:send-application? false`

### Fixes
- Autosaving does not cause the focus to jump anymore (#3112)
- Fix form table default sort order to be internal name (was title). (#3107)
- Editing form of a catalogue item could fail due to categories.
- While clicking a button, link or menu item, a wrong color was sometimes displayed.
- Heading focus outline uses the correct blue color.

## v2.31 "Harmajankatu" 2022-11-29

### Changes
- The location of the success message of a submit has been changed from the top of the page to the Actions block. (#2836)
  This is more consistent with the other actions that provide feedback in the same location. (#2836)
- The application Applicants block has a simple version for the case of a single applicant. (#2836)
- The Decide action button has been changed to primary action, as it usually is for a person in the `:decider` role. (#2836)

### Additions
- Visibility of the PDF and ZIP download actions can now be configured with `:show-pdf-action` and `:show-attachment-zip-action` (#3001)
- The Resources block can be hidden from the application view with `:show-resources-section`. This can be useful if there are few catalogue items. (#3000)
- The application title field, in the application state block is now shown only if the application description is not blank. (#2836)
- Orphan attachments could sometimes be saved, though not in use. They are now removed when an application is submitted. (#3041)
- Extra pages have been enhanced: (#2983, #2589, #3069)
  - They can be shown in top menu, footer, both or not at all with `:show-menu` and `:show-footer`
  - You can decide if you want the standard heading or not with `:heading`.
  - If localization of the file or link is not required, you can define the attributes at top level.
  - Who can see which extras can be tuned with `:roles` such as `:logged-in`, `:applicant` or `:handler`.
  - See `config-defaults.edn` for more details.

### Fixes
- The previous applications block is now shown only if there are some. (#2836)
- The application Actions block is now successfully hidden, if there are no actions available (#2836)
- The component guide page had accumulated some small errors that are now fixed. (#2836)
- The component guide links to component source code works again. (#3080)
- Saving application no longer crashes when a resource requires DUO:0000024 (MOR) code. This could occur when applicant had not entered a value for the date restriction field. (#3086)

## v2.30 "Kellosaarenranta" 2022-10-13

### Changes
- Some API methods have been unified with the rest by using the command pattern: (#3036)
  - Categories have a new `POST /create` and a `PUT /edit` endpoint like the others.
  - User settings have a new `PUT /edit` endpoint.
  - User has a `PUT /edit` endpoint, `/create` remains "create or update".
  - The changes should be backwards-compatible as the old endpoints remain.
  - The non-standard endpoints have been been deprecated and will be removed later.
- The text for saving has been changed "Alice saved a draft." -> "Alice updated the application.". This will be clearer in the future when autosave is enabled (#3045)
- When continuing an old application, the applicant will be shown a warning about problematic fields. (#3045)
- Data Use Ontology (DUO) is no longer shown in application UI if none of the resources contain DUO codes. (#3048)
- Mondo codes have been updated to version v2022-09-06. (#3031)

### Additions
- There is an experimental autosave mode that can be enabled. The application is automatically saved soon after the applicant makes a change.
  - Enable it with `:enable-autosave true`.
  - You may also want to turn on save compaction at the same time with `:enable-save-compaction true` to show less save events in the event history.
  - In the future, autosave may become the default mode. (#2767)
  - Applications don't yet automatically get reloaded, should another person be viewing the same application.
    This is a potential future feature. (see #2622, #2244)
- Data Use Ontology (DUO) codes are now rendered in application pdf. Rendered pdf styles have also been tuned for more consistent look. (#2857)
- Organization owners are now allowed to edit their own organizations owners. (#2828)
- Updated Mondo-code definitions to v2022-09-06. (#3031)

### Fixes
- License, create/edit license and create/edit catalogue item administrator views have been updated to display localized fields the same way other administrator views do. (#1334)
- Don't needlessly complain about the config keys that are passed automatically from system properties and the environment. (#2935)
- Application warning and error links were not functioning correctly for attachment fields. This is now fixed. (#2955)
- DUO fields are no longer editable in the UI when application is not in editable state. (#2997)
- Organization edit now requires user to be either owner or organization owner of the organization. (#2828)
- Organization owner is no longer allowed to toggle enable/disable and archive organization actions. These are available only to owner user. (#2828)
- Test/demo data creation now uses configured languages. Mismatch between configured languages and data localizations may cause issues in certain UI components. (#2334)
- Multiselect field is now correctly rendered in application pdf again. More than one selected value resulted in empty field value. (#3059)

## v2.29 "Länsisatamankatu" 2022-09-12

**NB: This release contains migrations!**
**NB: `workflow_licenses` table has been removed and the data is migrated to `workflow` table.**

### Additions
- Application list in UI can now be configured to hide certain columns using config option `:application-list-hidden-columns`. (#2861)
- Mondo codes have been updated to version v2022-08-01. (#3031)
- Licenses can now be added to workflows through user interface and API. Workflow licenses are included in applications, similar to resource licenses. (#2158)

### Fixes
- License, create/edit license and create/edit catalogue item administrator views have been updated to display localized fields the same way other administrator views do. (#1334)
- Don't needlessly complain about the config keys that are passed automatically from system properties and the environment. (#2935)

## v2.28 "Porkkalankatu" 2022-08-24

**NB: This release contains migrations!**
**NB: One of the migrations fixes organizations, that could be broken by previous features.**

### Additions
- Application UI view is now visually more compact for non-handler users. State and members blocks are collapsed initially, and can be expanded to show more details. (#2871)
- The packaged fonts are now only in WOFF and WOFF2 formats, as is required for extensive support these days. (#2592)
- Various improvements should improve performance:
  - Gzip compression has been enabled for the server, so it is more feasible to use REMS as a standalone server without a reverse-proxy / load-balancer.
  - Logo images are preloaded automatically as they are almost always required.
  - Initial data is injected to the initial HTML instead of separate requests afterwards. (#2958)
  - Some dependencies have been dropped resulting in a smaller bundle.
- Default metadata for the HTML index has been added under description and keywords tags. These can be overridden using extra translations (`:t.meta/description`, `:t.meta/keywords`) (#2679)
- Default `robots.txt` has been included that indexes everything but the `/api`. NB: the bots are not able to index most pages as they are behind the login. (#2680)
- HTTP/2 (and others) can be configured, see `:jetty-extra-params` in `config-defaults.edn`.
- Validate organization when adding or editing it. (#2964)
- Consecutive save events are compacted into one. This does not affect old save events. This is turned off by default, until the whole autosave feature is finished. (#2767)
- Application licenses are now rendered alphabetically in UI and PDF render. (#2979)
- Custom stylesheets can now be added using `:extra-stylesheets` configuration option. This can be used to include custom fonts, for example. Example stylesheet is included in `config-defaults.edn` and is located in `example-theme/extra-styles.css`. (#2869)
- Example custom stylesheet `example-theme/extra-styles.css` is included in Docker images built using `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose-config.yml`, so that default REMS fonts are automatically included when running REMS for the first time, for example. (#2869)

### Fixes
- Add missing migration to remove organization modifier and last modified from the data. (#2964)
- Read-only checkbox should look different from editable checkbox yet again. (#2974)
- Applicant member details now always have border in application user interface, even when there are no other members. (#2975)
- Version number is shown again in browser console instead of message "Version information not available". This was due to change in build logic introduced by Shadow-CLJS. (#2984)

## v2.27 "Lauttasaaren silta" 2022-06-06

NB: This is the first release with a new build tool – Shadow-CLJS.

### Additions
- Shopping cart can now be enabled or disabled in user interface with configuration option `:enable-cart`, which defaults to `true`. (#2720)

## v2.26 "Lauttasaarentie" 2022-05-25

**NB: This release contains migrations!**

NB: The login has changed to allow more configurable user identity and other attributes. Consider this a big change worth some manual testing to see that everything works.

NB: New feature, reminder email for application expiration uses new email template. If you enable the feature and you use customized email templates, please check `:t.email.application-expiration-notification/subject-to-member` and `:t.email.application-expiration-notification/message-to-member`.

### Breaking changes
- The actor of the command API (for applications) is now always validated. Previously, there was a chance that a non-existent user could be sent (used mostly by our internal tests). (#2771, #2824, #2772, #2821)
- User attributes are not saved on every request, only when logging in. (#2829)
- The `:oidc-userid-attribute` config has been renamed to `:oidc-userid-attributes` and has new options to allow internally renaming an attribute from IdP to REMS db. (#2771, #2821)
- Users are required a name, and optionally an email from the IdP to be allowed in. These can be configured, see `docs/configuration.md`. (#2889, #2929)
- User attributes have been renamed internally. If you directly accessed the database, please note that `eppn -> userid`, `commonName -> name` and `mail -> email`. (#2377)
- Application expiration notification can now be configured to send reminder email to applicant and members before expiration. This requires a change to the configuration option `:application-expiration`. Please read `docs/bots.md` section on Expirer bot. (#2906)

### Additions
- You can configure the OIDC attributes for name and email (see configuration.md)
- User in the API can be an internal REMS id or any of the `:oidc-userid-attributes` (provided that the user has logged in once and we have stored the identity. (#2821 #2772)
- Fake login page has been improved to include descriptions of the different users. (#2896)
- Errors are now handled in `oidc-callback` by redirecting to an error page. (#2856)
- Mail settings can be configured with the `:smtp` config including authentication. (#2895)
- More configurable logout. You can now override the redirect with `:oidc-logout-redirect-url`, as well as unset `:oidc-perform-revoke-on-logout`. See `configuration.md`. (#2916)

### Fixes
- API-key validity is not checked unless it is actually sent. (#2785)
- API-Keys are cached for a minute for a slight performance improvement. (#2785)
- Resources can be filtered in the API by `resid` (#2852)
- Hide applicant column and reduce font size to avoid previous applications to become too wide (#2855)
- Duplicated forms have been removed. Previously, if a workflow form was the same as a catalogue item form, that form would be duplicated. (#2853)
- An owner that is also an organization owner can now properly edit organization ownerships. (#2850)
- An owner could sometimes see a disabled catalogue item in the catalogue tree. (#2800)
- The column names in the tables and the field names in create/edit pages of the administration now match.
- Improve the accessibility of the small navbar. (#2907)
- Load config overrides from system properties and env (#2917)
- Application draft can now be saved even if there are validation warnings. (#2766)
- New application page no longer displays "Application: Success" message. (#2838)
- Blacklist API now returns HTTP 422 status if user or resource does not exist when adding or removing blacklist entry. (#2835)
- Add missing migration that slims down organization owners in the DB to just the id. (#2939)
- Only fetch the catalogue tree (or table) if it is shown (or otherwise needed). (#2930)
- Fix the catalogue tree nodes sometimes being empty when fetching it from the API (#2931)

## v2.25 "Meripuistotie" 2022-02-15

**NB: This release contains migrations!**
**NB: Trying to roll back by migrating down will likely not work as dropped column data can't be restored.**

### Breaking changes
- The columns owneruserid and modifieruserid have been removed as the audit_log effectively serves the same purpose. They were not consistently used. For the attachments the column has been renamed to userid. This is a breaking change for the API as some of these were exposed, but likely not used or useful. (#2823)

### Additions
- Bona fide pusher script for pushing bona fide status to Elixir. (#2513)
- Validate GA4GH claims by the public key from trusted issuer jku (instead of OIDC configuration). Configure `:ga4gh-visa-trusted-issuers` if needed. (#2798)
- Pollers have been made more robust, including timeouts for email sending (#2841)
- SSL certificate can now be configured and SSL enabled. HTTP port can be disabled. (#2844)
- `rename-user` will not bother reloading the application cache anymore (since it is usually run in a separate process from the server).

## v2.24 "Heikkiläntie" 2022-01-17

### Fixes
- Workflow forms persist even if changing resources.

## v2.23 "Melkonkatu" 2022-01-12

### Additions
- The change applicant command is now possible for the handler even for returned applications.
- There is a new experimental CLI command `rename-user` to handle the case where a single user's identity has changed. After running this command, one should also refresh the caches of the application server by restart.

## v2.22 "Vattuniemenkuja" 2021-12-21

### Additions
- (Experimental) Catalogue items can be assigned one or more categories and the catalogue shown as a tree grouped by category. There is an admin UI where categories can be created. See (#2768, #2764, #2770, #2769)

### Breaking changes
- The API used to return disabled items for all users, but in the future only for administrative users. The disabled items were never visible to normal users in our UI. This may technically break the usage of the catalogue API if a regular user or public catalogue is used.

## v2.21.1 "Veneentekijän(tie|kuja|kaari) +1" 2021-11-23

### Fixes
- Attachment uploading resulted in broken or empty files due to improper stream handling, this behaviour is now fixed. (#2786)

## v2.21 "Veneentekijän(tie|kuja|kaari)" 2021-10-04

**NB: This release contains migrations!**

### Breaking changes
- Application attachment file size can now be limited with configuration option `:attachment-max-size`. Configuration default size per attachment is 10MB. (#2715)
- REMS standalone CLI no longer starts the server if unrecognized command is passed, and will print help instead. (#2518 #2738)

### Additions
- "More info" support for DOI style resources (when `:enable-doi` flag is set) (#2701)
- There is a new v2 push API to sync entitlements outside of REMS. So far the only supported type is `:ega`. See [configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) for more details. (#2466)
- Handlers can be invited to a workflow by email using the API (#2650)
- Entitlement expiration field in application actions will now accept only future dates (#2674)
- Applications can now be removed automatically after an expiration threshold is exceeded, using configuration option `:application-expiration`. This feature is disabled by default. (#2665)

### Changes
- Reviewers are no longer able to see private field questions in generated application pdf. Forms are also no longer rendered in application page if they contain only private fields (#2161)

## v2.20 "Vattuniemenkatu" 2021-08-24

### Fixes
- Show the selected but disabled resources in Change resources autocomplete (#2702, #2693)

## v2.19 "Nahkahousuntie" 2021-06-28

### Fixes
- Pdf generation failed for applications that had table fields with no rows. Now fixed.
- Fix for missing notification-email from user settings

### Additions
- Pdf applications now contain license text (for inline licenses), url (for link licenses) or attachment name (for attachment licenses), and license acceptance status for applicant and members. (#2688)

## v2.18 "Särkiniemientie" 2021-05-18

### Changes
- The "Attachments (zip)" button in the UI now only downloads the current application attachments. Event attachments and previous versions of application attachments are left out. The full zip is still available via the API. (#2453)
- Changes to theming: (#2588)
  - Theme variables are now documented in [resources/config-defaults.edn](resources/config-defaults.edn).
  - The `:nav-color` now simply defaults to `:link-color`. Previously, it defaulted to `:color3` if `:link-color` is unset.
  - The theme variables `:danger-color` (didn't really affect anything) and `:phase-background-active` (wasn't used, overlaps with `:phase-bgcolor-active`) have been removed.
  - The default theme has minor visual changes:
    - color2 is lighter
    - table hover highlight is now dark-on-light instead of light-on-dark
    - link color used in nav bar
  - Some theme-related code was rewritten. There should be no changes to appearance, but bugs are possible.
- Setting `:log-authentication-details` now prints out details for failed OIDC HTTP requests.
- More validations in the API:
  - the values of multiselect fields (/api/applications/save-draft)
  - option and column keys (/api/forms/create, /api/forms/edit)

### Fixes
- Errors for invalid inputs (field values that are too long, invalid email addresses, etc.) are now rendered nicely. Previously the applicant just saw a "Save draft: Failed" message. (#2611)
- The application page no longer jumps to the top after adding an attachment. (#2616)
- Deleting drafts with attachments now works.
- A handler is now considered a handler even before first application comes in.

### Additions
- REMS now supports PostgreSQL version 13. (#2642)
- Experimental GA4GH Permissions API now allows users to query their own permissions via `/api/permissions/:user`. (#2631)
- The handler can now change the applicant of a submitted application. (#2581)
  - This feature can be disabled by adding `:application.command/change-applicant` to `:disable-commands`.
- Multiselect fields can now be used to control visibility of other fields. (#1947)

## v2.17 "Isokaari" 2021-04-12

**NB: This release contains migrations!**

### Breaking changes
- A new form field type "table" is now available. A table has a predefined set of columns, and applicants can fill in as many rows as they wish. **You can not roll back to an earlier release once your database contains applications with filled-in table fields. You will need to fix the database manually.** (#2551)

### Changes
- Forms now have both an internal name as well as a localized title instead of the non-localized title. (#2066)
  - The old style form titles are now deprecated in the API and a migration copies the title to the internal name. **Please, check and optionally change the form titles after the migration!**
  - Prefer the new `internal-name` or `external-title` fields instead.
  - The external title is shown to applicants in the application and internal name used throughout the administration.
  - The API supports the old style for now.
- Answers to conditional fields that are not visible are no longer stored by REMS. The API accepts answers for invisible fields but drops them. The UI does not send answers to invisible fields. (#2574)
- The "Assign external id" action now shows the previous assigned external id. (#2530)
- The form editor UI was reworked to look less cluttered. Many inputs are now hidden behind "Show" buttons by default. (#1899)
- It is now possible to create catalogue items without a form via both the API and the UI. (#2603)

### Fixes
- Searching for applications by the original REMS generated id works, even if another id has been assigned. (#2564)
- GA4GH Visa (output by the experimental /api/permissions API) timestamps are now in seconds, instead of milliseconds. (#2554)
- The REMS `reset` command line command now works even when you have duplicate resource ids in the database. (#2557)
  - In practice, this means that REMS will not recreate the unique constraint on resource ids, even when rolling back to old database schema versions.
- The form editor now checks that table, option and multiselect fields are created with at least one column/option. (#2564)
- The multiselect field label wasn't being bolded.
- Info text icon could appear even though the field description was empty.
- Changes to the default translation for the required form field: does not include an asterisk sign anymore.
- Fixed occasional "Invalid path whitelist entry" error when adding/updating api keys.

### Additions
- The example-theme now uses the Lato font.
- The field id can now be changed in the form editor. (#1804)
- "More info" support for EGA style resources (when :enable-ega flag is set) (#2466)
- Add phone number to field types in the form. (#2552)

## v2.16 "Länsiväylä" 2021-02-04

### Changes
- REMS no longer sends the Server: HTTP header to avoid leaking version information. (#2216)
- Text descriptions of some events in the log were phrased better. The created event also shows the original external id. (#2614)
- REMS now consistently uses the application server clock when creating timestamps. Previously, database time was used in some situations, leading to minor inconsistencies. Requires migration, but does not change visible behaviour. (#2540)

### Fixes
- CSS files are now marked as cacheable by browsers. In v2.15 they were mistakenly marked as uncacheable. (#2484)
- OIDC signing keys are now always fetched on login, fixing issues with OIDC key rotation requiring a REMS restart. (#2497)
- /api/resource/<id>, /api/license/<id> and /api/organization/<id> now return HTTP 404 responses if id is not found.

### Additions
- The browser tests will now fail if there are any accessibility violations. (#2463)
- The OIDC configuration is now validated, and REMS refuses to start without a valid OIDC configuration. See the `:oidc-metadata-url` configuration variable and [configuration.md](docs/configuration.md). (#2519)
- The handler can be shown both the assigned external id and the original REMS generated external id. This behavior can be enabled by changing the `:application-id-column` config to `:generated-and-assigned-external-id`. These have also been added as new values to the data model and the original `:application/external-id` kept as it is. (#2614)
- The navbar can be configured to show a logo image. When the `:navbar-logo-name` config is provided, the logo is shown in the navbar (top navigation menu). This logo also can be customized per language like the regular logo. (#2363)


## v2.15 "Tapiolantie" 2021-01-08

### Changes
- The actions area has been adjusted to work better on small screens. (#2501)
- Copying a draft application will now create a new draft but without a link to the previous (draft) application. (#2496)

### Fixes

- Fixed link in the "You will need to add an email address to your settings" notification. (#2503)
- Previous application history shown to the handler is now correctly limited to the members of the application. (#2470)

  API and event schemas. All applications should already have an external ID
  since the previous release, so no database migration should be needed.

  to pdf" in your browser.
- The `start`, `end` and `expired` fields have been removed from licenses,
  workflows, resources, and forms.

  There is now a single API call that is used to create both a catalogue
  item and the localizations, namely, /api/catalogue-items/create.

  have been changed:
  - The API endpoint for editing content (the name and handlers) of a
    workflow is now /api/workflows/edit.

    a form, a resource, or a license is /archived, prefixed with
    /api/workflows, /api/catalogue-item, /api/forms, /api/resources,
    or /api/licenses, respectively.
  - The endpoint for enabling or disabling a workflow, a catalogue item,
    a form, a resource, or a license is /enabled, prefixed with
    /api/workflows, /api/catalogue-items, /api/forms, /api/resources,
    or /api/licenses, respectively.
- API endpoint for editing forms has been changed from
  /api/forms/[form-id]/edit to /api/forms/edit.
- The page addresses are no more prefixed with `/#/`, so for example the address
  of the catalogue page was changed from `/#/catalogue` to `/catalogue` (#1258)

WARNING! The migration has problems with databases where licenses have been revoked, if the related entitlements are still active. See #1372.

1. Run lein run migrate in rems/ repository. NOTE! If you can't run lein on target server, use an SSH tunnel. Make sure you have no previous tunnels running!
   ssh -L 5432:remsdbserver:5432 remsappserver
   AND then run on your local machine:
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pw@localhost/db_name" lein run migrate

2. Create a dynamic workflow

3. Check new, dynamic workflow id from database:
   select * from workflow order by start desc;

4. Run on your own machine lein run convert-to-dynamic <dynamic_workflow_id> NOTE! If you can't run lein on target server, see step 1 for tunneling.

5. Verify from database that all applications have the new, dynamic workflow id in column wfid: select * from catalogue_item_application;

6. Go to administration page in UI and archive all non-dynamic workflows. If you do not have admin privileges, add them by adding owner role for yourself into the database:
   insert into roles (userid, role) = ('[userid]', 'owner')
   where [userid] is the eppn of your account (email address).

7. Verify from ui that different kind of applications still work.
