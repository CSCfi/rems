# Event notification

REMS can be configured to send events notifications over HTTP.

Event notifications are sent _one at a time_, waiting for a HTTP
200 response from the notification endpoint. Everything except a HTTP
200 response counts as a failure. Failed notifications are retried
with exponential backoff for up to 12 hours.

Due to retries, the event notification endpoint _should be_ idempotent.

Initial event notifications for each event are _guaranteed to be in
order_ of event creation, but retries might be out-of-order.

Event notification failures are logged. You can also inspect the
`outbox` db table for the retry state of notifications.

## Configuration

See `:event-notification-targets` in [config-defaults.edn](../resources/config-defaults.edn).

## Basics

- To react you must first check the event type to see if it's interesting.
- Always return HTTP 200 `"OK"` if the message was received. Otherwise it will be retried.
- Use the application state from under key `event/application` or consider not requesting it at all.

### Case: Listening to "new" applications

Most handling organizations will only want to listen to `SubmittedEvent`. This is the point when an applicant has deemed the application ready for review. By default the application is not visible to anyone else before this.

### Case: Listening to "closed" applications

Applications that reach an "end state" are such that there will be one of these events:
- `ApprovedEvent` normal
- `RejectedEvent` normal
- `ClosedEvent` normal
- `RevokedEvent` misbehavior by user (not always in use)
- `DeletedEvent` applicant deleted the application or it has expired (not always in use)

NB: `DecidedEvent` is sent when a potential decider has marked the decision they've made. The application is not yet considered approved or rejected.

## Event Types

The body of the HTTP PUT request will be a JSON object that contains at a minimum:

- Properties of `EventBase`
- Optionally the properties of `EventWithcomment`
- Properties of the concrete event type (e.g. `SubmittedEvent`)
- `event/application`: Optionally the entire application, with this event applied, in the same format as the `/api/applications/:id/raw` endpoint returns (see Swagger docs)
  This can be left out with `:send-application? false` in the configuration but it is included by default as many integrations would need to fetch some of it anyway.

### EventBase

The `EventBase` forms the base event data that is common for all events. Each event can have more specific data such as comment, attachments, person invited etc.

- `event/id`  A unique event identifier, a sequential growing number
- `event/type` Type of the event. A keyword.
- `event/actor`: Who caused the event, e.g. did an action. A string whose value is derived from the IdP identity attributes.
- `event/time` When the event occured.
- `application/id`: A unique identifier of the application this event belongs to. A number.

### EventWithComment

This is a further base type for events that the actor can comment or add attachments to.
Many different event types support these.

- `application/comment` Optional comment text
- `event/attachments` Optional array of attachment ids (numbers)

### ApprovedEvent

The `ApprovedEvent` happens when a handler or decider (depending on workflow type) approves the application.

- `event/type` always `application.event/approved`
- `entitlement/end` Optional time when the entitlement will expire.

```json
{
  "event/id": 668,
  "event/type": "application.event/approved",
  "event/actor": "HIJ123XYZ789",
  "event/time": "2023-12-22T08:01:53.606Z",
  "application/comment": "Thank you! Approved!",
  "application/id": 136,
  "event/application": {...}
}
```

NB: can include comments

### ClosedEvent

The `ClosedEvent` happens when either the applicant or a handler closes the application for good. An application can't be re-opened. This could be for example when a research project ends and the access rights are not required anymore.

- `event/type` always `application.event/closed`

No additional fields.

NB: can include comments

```json
{
  "event/id": 693,

  "application/id": 139,
  "event/application": {...}
}
```

### ReviewedEvent

The `ReviewedEvent` happens when a reviewer has feedback on the application. This could be in the form of the comment or an attachment.
