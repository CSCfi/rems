# Releases and releasing

## Naming
Releases are named by streets starting from CSC headquarters in Keilaniemi.

I.e. Keilaranta (v2.0), Otaniementie (v2.1), Vuorimiehentie (v2.2.), Tekniikantie (v2.3) to Tietotie (v2.4).
The destination to aim for is up to you.

See [Release page](https://github.com/CSCfi/rems/releases).

## Release notes

Release notes can be found in the [changelog](../CHANGELOG.md). The
changelog is updated by developers via the normal pull request process.

Releases can be found on the github [release page](https://github.com/CSCfi/rems/releases).

## Step-by-step instructions for creating a release (standard release from master)

1. Checkout the code. For the most recent master, e.g.,

   `git fetch; git checkout origin/master` 

2. Edit CHANGELOG.md:

   - See the name of the previous release, find the street with that name,
     select a street that is next to that street but is not yet used as
     a release name.

   - Add a line for the new release, e.g.,
     `## v2.6 "Kalevalantie" 2018-11-12`

   - Move all changes from under `## Unreleased` to under the new release

   - Leave `Changes since v[x.y]` text under `## Unreleased`

3. Create a pull request for those changes (e.g. branch `release-2.6` with commit `release: v2.6`)

4. After the branch is merged to master:

   `git checkout master; git pull`

5. Tag the branch, e.g.,

   `git tag -a v2.6 -m "Release v2.6, \"Kalevalantie\""`

6. Push the tag,

   `git push origin v2.6`

7. Wait for the release to build on CircleCI.

8. Get the `rems.jar` package for the release from CircleCI.
   You can do this manually or using `../rems-deploy/scripts/fetch_from_circle.sh tags/v2.6`

9. Go to the github page for the release, e.g.,

   https://github.com/CSCfi/rems/releases/tag/v2.6

10. From "Edit tag", change the name of the tag to the release title,
   e.g., "Kalevalantie".

11. Copy changes under the new release from CHANGELOG.md to "Description"
    field:

    - Change lines starting with `###` to `##` for better formatting

12. Press "Attach binaries" to upload the `rems.jar` you got in step 8.

13. Press "Publish release".

## Instructions for a minor patch release (hotfix to existing release)

   You can follow the standard release instructions above with the following notes:
   
- You should checkout the tag, e.g.
   
   `git fetch; git checkout v2.21`
   
   Then create the branch for the new release, e.g. `release-2.21.1`.
   Then do commits, apply any patch, cherry-pick etc. as you wish.
   
- Release naming

   A nice way to rename a minor release is to add a ..1 and "+1" to the name, e.g.
   
   `v2.21 "Veneentekijän(tie|kuja|kaari)" 2021-10-04` becomes `v2.21.1 "Veneentekijän(tie|kuja|kaari) +1" 2021-11-2`
   
   and create a branch `release-2.21.1`.
   
 - Tag as normal and push the tag (e.g. `v2.21.1`).

   Circle will notice the tag and build the release for you.
   
 - GitHub will list the tag and allow you to create the release from it.
   
 - Include the CHANGELOG and JAR and remember to update the master CHANGELOG to match.

 - A PR is optional but useful.
   
   For example to work on the hotfix, reviewing it and run tests.

## Updating dependencies

After the release is done we want to update all the dependencies to the latest available versions.
You can do it via:
  - Check for new versions of packages with ```lein ancient```
  - make sure you do not update dependencies that have no-update comment in ```project.clj```
  - The recommended order is:
    - ```clojure/clojurescript```
    - backend
    - frontend
    - ```reframe/reagent```

**note:** Be careful upgrading ```reagent``` and ```re-frame```due to extensive testing required!

## Clean the Project board

Clean accepted column in the project board after release is done ("archive all cards" action).
