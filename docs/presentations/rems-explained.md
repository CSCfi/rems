# REMS, the Resource Entitlement Management System

Resource Entitlement Management System (REMS) is an open source tool for managing access rights to different kinds of resources. REMS enables users to apply for access rights easily and offers a secure way for the data owners to manage access to their data.

The resources in REMS do not necessarily have to be electronic data sets. It is possible to manage access to basically anything, as long as it is identified by some form of an identifier. This includes for example research datasets and biological samples.

REMS is being developed by CSC – IT Center for Science Ltd., and Nitor Oy.

# Benefits for the resource owner

- A dynamic way to handle applications and manage access rights: The data owner can define for example, how involved they want to be in the approval process and how the process proceeds.
- An audit trail of all committed actions and enhanced reporting tools to improve application traceability: you can look at the application’s full processing history.
- Customisable application process: ability to create and modify the application forms.
- Automation: Some functions, such as approving and rejecting applications, can be automated to reduce unnecessary workload.

# Benefits for the applicant

- Use their existing institution user account for login.
- Follow the application process easily with REMS's event log.
- See all their applications in one place and check their state easily.
- Add possible research group members to their application: all the research group members will get access to the data with just one application instead of everyone applying for access separately.
