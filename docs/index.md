# Resource Entitlement Management System (REMS)

REMS is an open source tool for managing access rights to resources, such as research datasets.

Applicants can use their federated user IDs to log in to REMS, fill in the data access application and agree to the dataset's terms of use. The REMS system then circulates the application to the resource owner or designated representative for approval. REMS also produces the necessary reports on the applications and the granted data access rights. 

You can try out REMS using publicly available demo instance at <https://rems2demo.csc.fi>.
